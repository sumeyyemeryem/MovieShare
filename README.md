In this experiment, we have implemented a library MovieShare system by using linked lists. Information about users and movies will be stored in this library system. The users is able to check out movies from the library and is able to return them to the library. In this system,there are three linked lists for users. These are, a linked list to store users and a linked list for each user to store movies checked out by that user, and a linked list that stores movies not checked out by any user.
